  - convert_pdbqt:
      in:
        input_path: '*conformer.mol2'
#        output_pdb_path: '&ligand_keywords.pdbqt'
        # NOTE: There is no way to preserve the order of the atoms. Indeed, the
        # structure of the pdbqt flexibility annotations forces atoms in the same
        # branch of the torsion tree to be listed sequentially in the pdbqt file.
        # This loses topological information, in particular bond order.
        # TODO: After docking, we need to extract the coordinates (only) from
        # the poses and combine them with the original topology information.
        # The alternative is to 'just' use openbabel, but that uses heuristics
        # to guess the bond orders, which are far from perfect. We need the correct
        # bond order information when generating the MD parameters with e.g. acpype.
        # The topology doesn't depend on the coordinates, so why don't we just use
        # the original mol2 file with acpype (i.e. before docking)? The problem is
        # that in gromacs (specifically append_ligand and cat_pdb), the order of
        # the atoms in the topology and coordinate files must match. If not, this
        # effectively permutes the ligand coordinates. This causes the energy
        # to be massive, which you can easily see in the first minimization plot.
  - bash_pdb:
  # NOTE: split_pdbqt coincidentally also removes keywords.
      in:
      # Remove the MODEL and ENDMDL keywords.
      # Even if there is actually only one model, autodock simply looks for MODEL and ENDMDL.
      # Unfortunately, all of the errors crash with the same cryptic message:
      # Parse error on line ... in file ".../ligand.pdbqt": Unknown or inappropriate tag
        script: /pdbqt_remove_keywords.sh # NOTE: Initial / required
#        input_pdb_path: '*ligand_keywords.pdbqt'

  - bash_pdb:

      # Add ROOT, ENDROOT, TORSDOF keywords (if necessary).
