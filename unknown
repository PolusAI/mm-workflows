# As the file name and its content are unknown, it's impossible to provide the corrected version of the file. However, the general approach to fix the issue would be as follows:

# Suppose the problematic script is as follows:

#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == "hello" ]; then
  echo "Hello, world!"

# The corrected version of the script would be:

#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == "hello" ]; then
  echo "Hello, world!"
fi
