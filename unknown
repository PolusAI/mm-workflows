if [ "$CONDITION" == "true" ]; then
  echo "Condition is true"
fi
```

Or if a 'do' loop was missing a 'done', the corrected script might look like this:

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
   echo "Welcome $i times"
done
```

Or if a string was missing a closing quote, the corrected script might look like this:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
